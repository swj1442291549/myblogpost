I'm Weijia Sun (å­™å”¯ä½³), a PhD candidate in [Department of Physics](http://astro.pku.edu.cn/) and [Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/) (KIAA) at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), where I work with [Richard de Grijs](http://astro-expat.info/) and [Licai Deng](https://www.iau.org/administration/membership/individual/335/). My main research interest is star cluster evolution in terms of stellar rotation.           

These days, I'm using high-precision photometry and median-resolution spectroscopy to study the connection between single star evolution and cluster evolution. *Stellar rotation* is my thing. I am also interested in the stellar evolution, e.g., the binaries and all the other interesting features related to clusters. ðŸ˜€
